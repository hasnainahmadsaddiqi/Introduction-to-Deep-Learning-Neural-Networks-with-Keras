## Project Overview

I implemented an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for aircraft damage analysis. 
The project uses a pretrained VGG16 model for damage classification and a transformer-based model for image captioning. 
It demonstrates transfer learning, image preprocessing, and multimodal inference for automated inspection support.
